README of the CurrencyConvertorApp project

This app was created for an internship case study.
The goal of this app is to convert an amount of a currency
into the correct value of an other currency.

Just type the amount you want to convert in the left box
or the right box and the conversion will do itself.
You can select the currency you want to use for each side
individually and you can also switch the currencies between
themselves by touching the "Switch" button.
